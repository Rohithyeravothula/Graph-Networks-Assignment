Assignment 1, python script is used to simulate

part1: resource of individual depends on his own resource at previous time instance

simulation parameters
individuals = 1000
resources = 10000
time stamps = 1000

resource function = const*math.pow(a[i],power_a)*math.pow(b[i],power_b)   
a corresponds to abilities
b corresponds to resources

Inference:

1)After simulation from graph plotting we can observe that "rich re getting richer" phenomena clearly and after 80% of simulation out of total wealth 90% of wealth is with 10-20 individuals


part2: resource of individual depends on his own resource at previous time instance and his own degree

simulation parameters
individuals = 1000  
time stamps = 20 
resources=10000

a rando network is developed using python script to simulate 

resource function = const*math.pow(a[i],power_a)*math.pow(b[i],power_b)*math.pow(count_edge,power_c)

a corresponds to abilities
b corresponds to resources

Inference:

2) After simulation from graph plotting we can observe that "rich re getting richer" phenomena and also initial resource is playing role and may be over taken later depending on how is the function dependent on degree of individual

part2: resource of individual depends on his own resource at previous time instance and his neighbourhood resources

simulation parameters
individuals = 1000  
time stamps = 10 
resources=10000

a rando network is developed using python script to simulate 

resource function = const*math.pow(a[i],power_a)*math.pow(b[i],power_b)*math.pow(neighbourhood resources),power_c)

a corresponds to abilities
b corresponds to resources

Inference:

 1) after simulation from graph plotting we can observe that "rich re getting richer" phenomena will fail 
 2) initial resource is playing role and may be over taken later depending on how is the function dependent on degree of individual
 3) rapid exchange of resources can be observed depending on the neighbourhood resources available
